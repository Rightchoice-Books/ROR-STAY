The AI engineer successfully initiated the ROR STAY application development, focusing entirely on the frontend with mock data, as per the user's explicit request. The process involved clarifying initial requirements, gathering real estate specific images via the , and then systematically building key UI components (Header, Hero, Features, Listings, Contact, Footer) using Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS. A critical phase involved debugging a syntax error in the  component related to unescaped quotes in an SVG background URL, demonstrating effective troubleshooting by analyzing logs and performing targeted fixes. Post-fix, the engineer verified the frontend's visual integrity and functionality through screenshots and interactive element testing, confirming that mock features like the contact form, mock map, and property filters were operational. The work concluded with the AI engineer prompting the user for the next phase: backend development.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a conversion-optimized, agency-quality landing page for ROR STAY, a real estate platform. The application should feature psychological triggers, layered design, glass-morphism effects, emotionally impactful visuals, clear messaging, and intuitive navigation. Specific user requests included:
1.  **Frontend-first with Mock Data**: Implement the entire frontend using mock data for a quick preview.
2.  **Mock Map Interface**: Include a placeholder map functionality within the frontend.
3.  **Real Estate Industry Standards**: Design and content (especially images) should align with real estate industry aesthetics.
4.  **Stock Real Estate Images**: Utilize high-quality stock images relevant to property listings.

The implemented frontend includes a professional header, a compelling hero section with trust indicators, a Why Choose ROR STAY? features section with Lucide-React icons, a property listings section with mock data and filter dropdowns, and a functional contact form with mock map functionality and validation. All interactive elements work as expected with client-side mock logic.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: The main entry point for the React application, responsible for routing and integrating top-level components.
    -   **Changes made**: Modified to incorporate , , , , , and  components, replacing the initial placeholder content.
-   **/app/frontend/src/data/mock.js**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Stores all mock data used by the frontend components, such as hero section text, feature details, and property listings. This separates mock data from component logic for easier backend integration later.
    -   **Changes made**: Created to provide mock data for all sections of the landing page.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Header.jsx**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Implements the navigation bar, including the app logo and navigation links.
    -   **Changes made**: New file created.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Hero.jsx**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Displays the primary call-to-action and key value proposition, featuring a headline, tagline, and trust indicators.
    -   **Changes made**: New file created. Initially contained a syntax error (unescaped quotes in an SVG background URL) which was identified and fixed.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Features.jsx**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Showcases the core benefits of using ROR STAY, with descriptive text and corresponding Lucide-React icons.
    -   **Changes made**: New file created.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Listings.jsx**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Presents property listings with filtering options, displaying details like price, location, and room type.
    -   **Changes made**: New file created.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Contact.jsx**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Provides a contact form, mock map interface, and various contact methods for users to reach out. Includes client-side validation for form fields.
    -   **Changes made**: New file created.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Footer.jsx**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Contains copyright information and links.
    -   **Changes made**: New file created.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed the entire frontend development of the ROR STAY application. This involved creating all necessary React components: , , , , , and . All components utilize mock data stored in .

A key part of the current work involved debugging and resolving a syntax error in the  component related to unescaped quotes within an SVG background URL. This was identified through  and fixed.

After resolving the error and restarting the frontend server, the AI engineer verified the application's functionality. Screenshots confirmed the visual correctness and adherence to design principles. Furthermore, interactive elements such as the contact form (with field validation), mock map functionality (displaying coordinates on click), form submission (client-side confirmation), and property filter dropdowns were all tested and confirmed to be working correctly with their mock implementations. The website now provides a complete and functional frontend teaser for the full-stack application.
